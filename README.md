# Neural Machine Translation

This is a collection of models and data processing scripts for my personal
investigation into using Deep Learning on Neural Machine Translation (NMT) tasks.

The goals of this repo are:

- to understand different NMT models used for deep learning
- to investigate good pre-processing steps for NMT
- to investigate hyperparameters that work well with different parts
  of model development (training, model architecture, pre-processing, etc...)

_NOTE: These notebooks won't work as is because they rely on local copies of
datasets which are too big to store on Github._
